Welcome to craftableNameTags

This super straight forward plugin is unnoticable on recourses and easy to configure

```yml
recipe-line-1: '#1#'
recipe-line-2: '121'
recipe-line-3: '345'
# for an empty slot use #
item-1: "DIAMOND"
item-2: "GOLD_INGOT"
item-3: "IRON_INGOT"
item-4: "EMERALD"
item-5: "NETHERITE_INGOT"
```

To change the recipie shape of the recpie change the respective slot, for empty slots use #
e.g. the recipie for top line of the crafting window will be, <nothing>, Diamond, <nothing>

Items must be in the same format, case sentative.
